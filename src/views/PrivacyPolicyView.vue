        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for
        materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</p>


      <h4>Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>

      <p>The CPRA defines the term “Sharing” as follows”: "Shared" is based on the definition found in the CPRA, section
        1799.140(ah)(1): "“Share,” “shared,” or “sharing” means sharing, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating,
        making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a
        consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether
        or not for monetary or other valuable consideration, including transactions between a business and a third party for
        cross-context behavioral advertising for the benefit of a business in which no money is exchanged."</p>

      <p>Based on the above definition, we share your information with the following categories of third parties:</p>

      <ol class="ul-content lower-alpha">
        <li>Advertising networks (Google)</li>
        <li>Data analytics providers</li>
        <li>Social networks</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We also disclose your personal information to the following categories of entities for a business purpose,
        including:</p>

      <ol class="ul-content lower-alpha">
        <li>Service Providers</li>
        <li>Contractors</li>
      </ol>

      <p>When we disclose personal information to a service provider or a contractor for a business purpose, we enter into a
        contract that requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any
        purpose except performing the contract.</p>

      <p>We also may disclose personal information to our affiliates or, if required by law, to a governmental entity.</p>

      <h5>Sale of Personal Information</h5>

      <p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, Company has not sold personal information.</p>

      <h4>Your Rights and Choices</h4>

      <p>The Acts provide consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This
        section describes your rights under the Acts and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>

      <h5>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</h5>

      <p>You have the right to know what personal information we have collected, used, or disclosed and can request a copy
        of that data in a portable format.</p>


      <h5>Deletion or Correction Request Rights</h5>

      <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and
        retained, subject to certain exceptions. You also have the right to request that we update or correct any of your
        personal information that we collected from you and retained that is incorrect. Once we receive and confirm your
        verifiable consumer request, we will delete or correct (and, where applicable, direct our service providers to
        delete or correct) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>

      <p>We may deny your deletion or correction request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service
        provider(s) to:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you
          requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you,
          fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise
          perform our contract with you.
        </li>
        <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute
          those responsible for such activities.
        </li>
        <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
        <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise
          another right provided for by law.
        </li>
        <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).</li>
        <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that
          adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render
          impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
        </li>
        <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship
          with us.
        </li>
        <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you
          provided it.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Right to Limit the Use or Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</h5>

      <p>The CPRA specifically grants Consumers the right to limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive personal
        information to actions necessary to perform the specific purposes permitted under the Acts. We can continue using or
        disclosing your sensitive personal information after receiving a limitation request from you, for the following
        purposes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>To perform services or provide goods that an average consumer requesting those goods or services would
          reasonably
          expect.
        </li>
        <li>To help ensure security and integrity if that use is reasonably necessary and proportionate.</li>
        <li>To perform short-term, transient uses, including but not limited to non-personalized advertising shown as part
          of
          your current interaction with the us, if we do not:
          <ul>
            <li>disclose the sensitive personal information to another third party; or</li>
            <li>use it to build a profile about you or otherwise alter your experience outside of your current interaction
              with
              us.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To perform services, including:
          <ul>
            <li>maintaining or servicing accounts;</li>
            <li>providing customer service;</li>
            <li>processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying your information, processing payments, providing

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          or controlled by us.
        </li>
        <li>To improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or
          controlled by us.
        </li>
        <li>To perform other actions that CPRA regulations authorize.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Exercising Access, Data Portability, Correction, Deletion, or Limitation of Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information Rights</h5>

      <p>To exercise the access, data portability, correction, deletion and limitation of use and disclosure of sensitive
        personal information rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Calling us at +1 (440) 709-1601 or</li>
        <li>Visiting <a href="https://1stclass.delivery/ccpa">https://1stclass.delivery/ccpa</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to
        your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
      <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The
        verifiable consumer request must:</p>


      <ul>
        <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected
          personal information or an authorized representative.
        </li>
        <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to
          it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or
        authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>
      <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
      <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity
        or authority to make the request.</p>

      <h5>Response Timing and Format</h5>

      <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require
        more time (up to an additional 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
      <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.
        The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data
        portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and
        should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
      <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
        repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made
        that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

      <h5>Right to Opt-Out of Sharing of Personal Information for Cross-Contextual Behavioral Advertising Purposes</h5>

      <p>Cross-contextual behavioral advertising, commonly referred to as targeted advertising, is the tracking of a
        consumer’s activities across websites, applications, and services to identify and present advertisements tailored to
        their behavior. You have the right to Opt-Out of our cross-contextual behavioral advertising. You will be presented
        the option to exercise this Opt-Out right when you visit one of our websites and can state your preferences at that
        time.</p>

      <h4>Non-Discrimination</h4>

      <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the Acts. Unless permitted by the
        Acts, we will not:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
        <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other
          benefits, or imposing penalties.
        </li>
        <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
        <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of
          goods or services.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h4>Changes to Our Privacy Notice</h4>

        privacy notice, we will post the updated notice on the Website and update the notice's effective date. <strong>Your
